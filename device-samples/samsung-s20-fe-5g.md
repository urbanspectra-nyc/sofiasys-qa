# PERFORMANCE

Dubbed one of the most affordable iPhones to ever be released, the iPhone 11 has nearly everything you need packaged in a sleek design and at a fraction of the price. The performance in this model is comparable to the Pro and Pro Max models, backed by the freaky fast A13 Bionic chip. Jump back and forth between apps and functions with ease, stream videos effortlessly and sharpen your gaming skills with the all-new Apple Arcade. This model is equipped with a major software update that includes a fully revamped Photos app and a dark viewing mode. All of this can be used and enjoyed on a powerful all-day battery charge.

# DISPLAY

Whether you're binge watching your favorite new show or scrolling your feeds, the display on the iPhone 11 fully delivers. This model features a 6.1 inch Liquid Retina HD display, slightly larger than the iPhone XS with comparable color and motion. Step in and out of different environmental lighting and experience the magic that is True Tone technology, an auto-adjustment for color and screen intensity based on your surroundings. The LCD Multi-Touch display on the iPhone 11 allows you to control all functions on the phone with simple finger gestures, and it's topped off with a finger-print resistant coating for reduced smudging.

# CAMERA

This phone makes it pretty difficult to take a bad photo, no matter what your photography experience is. The iPhone 11 features a brand new 120-degree ultra-wide-angle lens to take cinematic pictures with a single finger tap. This is in included in the new ultra-wide 12-MP camera lens, the same main camera as the iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max models. Take stunning, studio-level portraits in the popular Portrait mode with the TrueDepth feature, take your pick of the many shots captured in HDR and burst modes, forget about shaky pics and video with optical image stabilization and shoot clean 4K video all on the iPhone 11.

# OTHER FEATURES

The iPhone 11 packs a serious punch as the 2019 starting model, including most of the major new features with exciting new additions. The upgraded photo and video apps allow you to edit directly from your phone with ease, and the redesigned glass makes it one of the toughest models to date. The splash, dust and water resistance are upgraded in the iPhone 11 as well. Face ID makes it harder than ever for intruders to unlock this model, and you can breathe easy with simple wireless charging when you're in a bind for time. The iPhone 11 has everything you could need and more, and it's available at Gazelle for even less.
